# Vulkan Raytracer

Source code for the "A Study on Modern Raytracing in Vulkan" I'm conducting as part of competency development initiative at work. 

The purpose of the project is to combine two aspects:
* Review and summarize the history of raytracing to gain an understanding of it's current state
* Learn to use the Vulkan API in order to demonstrate a ray tracing implementation on the GPU
